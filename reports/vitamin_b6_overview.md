### Background

Vitamin B6 is an essential B vitamin composed of three pyridine derivatives, including pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine. It is an important cofactor for a large number of biochemical reactions.

This report dives into the role of vitamin B6 in the human body, with an emphasis on neurological function.

### Report

Vitamin B6's most active form is pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, or PLP/P5P. It is converted into cofactors for other enzymatic processes.

One study found that exogenous vitamin B6 intake significantly reduced the risk of coronary heart disease. One idea for why this occurs is a reduction in homocysteine levels through a conversion to cysteine or methionine.

Several other studies found that exogenous vitamin B6 intake reduces hypertension and high blood pressure. The reason could be a reduction of blood aldehydes.

Studies find that exogenous vitamin B6 intake is protective against progressive kidney disease due to diabetic nephropathy. This could be due to the vitamin being used to reduce sugars and fats in the blood, preventing the formation of AGE and ALE.

In terms of neurology, vitamin B6 is required for the biosynthesis of serotonin, dopamine, and GABA. Because serotonin biosynthesis requires DOPA decarboxylase (or aromatic amino acid decarboxylase), vitamin B6 is a required cofactor for maintaining healthy appetite, sleep, cognitive function, and overall well being. Low levels of vitamin B are implicated in depression, brain dysfunction (epilepsy), and more.

Vitamin B6 is also a potent antioxidant.

### Summary

Vitamin B6 is an essential vitamin to maintain healthy bodily function and to prevent neuroticism.
