  # Drug-Induced Adaptive Changes

[Source](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.191352698)

### Background

Chronic administration of some drugs eventually causes a reduction in effects, a phenomenon called drug tolerance. The dose of the drug usually needs to be increased in order to experience the same effects that a lower dose could once provide 

This report details the biological mechanisms behind adaptive changes relating to drug tolerance and addiction.

### Report

Research discovered that overexpression of the ΔFosB transcription factor, particularly in the nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum, are correlated with enhanced sensitivity to the rewarding effects of drugs.

ΔFosB is particularly interesting because unlike other gene transcription factors, it has an extremely long half life. When ΔFosB-inducing drugs (such as cocaine or morphine) are continuously administered, ΔFosB levels compound, manifesting in long-term genetic adaptations that sensitizes individuals to the drug. ΔFosB is implicated as being a major factor in drug addiction.

Other behavioral changes associated with ΔFosB are a tendency to self-administer low doses of cocaine, increased motivation for cocaine, and increased anxiolysis from alcohol. 

The AMPA glutamate receptor subunit GluR2 is correlated with increased drug reward sensitivity, which could explain the downstream changes caused by elevated ΔFosB. This leads to reduced AMPA and Ca2+ transmission, increasing neuron sensitivity towards the inhibitory and reinforcing effects of drugs.

Dynorphin gene encoding is another possible factor to explain the effects of elevated ΔFosB; dynorphin inhibits dopaminergic neurons via kappa opioid receptors.

Interestingly, the CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) transcription factor induces dynorphin expression and therefore reduces the rewarding effects of drugs. CREB could explain the phenomenon known as drug tolerance, where the effects of rewarding drugs attenuates after repeated administration.

In terms of "permanent" adaptive drug-related changes, it is possible that the changes made by transcription factors can increase dendritic spine density and therefore glutamatergic efficacy during long-term potentiation. Since ΔFosB induces Cdk5, a Cdk5 inhibitor would prevent dendritic spine density changes caused by repeated drug exposure. Another possibility is that the changes induced by transcription factors alters the chromatin itself, leading to permanent plasticity changes.

### Summary

ΔFosB mediates enhanced sensitivity to the rewarding effects on drugs. It compounds rapidly with repeated drug exposure and decays very slowly.

CREB, another transcription factor, may explain the reduced effect of a drug after repeated administration via reducing the rewarding dopaminergic effect.

It is unclear if "permanent" drug tolerance exists, but it is theorized to be caused by enhanced efficiency of glutamate neurons in relevant brain regions, or by alterations of chromatin.
