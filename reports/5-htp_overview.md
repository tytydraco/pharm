### Background

5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin, and it holds a critical role for human health.

This report dives into the pharmacology of 5-HTP.

### Report

5-HTP, or L-5-hydroxytryptophan, is produced from tryptophan and tryptophan hydroxylase. 5-HTP is decarboxylated into 5-HT, or serotonin, where it is then transformed into melatonin.

5-HTP was traditionally extracted from some plants to relieve motion sickness, increase satiety in a food deficit, and reduce anxiety. 

5-HTP is capable of inhibiting gastric acid secretion and increasing peristaltic activity.

It also suppresses inflammation and arthritis by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators.

In excess, 5-HTP produces neurotoxicity by degrading the blood-brain barrier, edema formation, and nitric oxide production.

In rats, 5-HTP produced a 6-11-fold increase in prolactin. It is also capable of inducing depression via the 5-HT2 receptor.

5-HTP intake prompts an increase in serotonin synthesis via the blockade of 5-HT1A receptors.

5-HTP produces a substantial increase in melatonin.

Excessive 5-HTP supplementation can cause serotonin syndrome symptoms.

5-HTP is linked with peripheral and central side effects, including gastrointestinal distress, hyperthermia, hypertension, anxiety, vomiting, and nausea.

It evokes antidepressant and anxiolytic activity due to monoaminergic activation of serotonin.

5-HTP significantly increased REM sleep from 5% to 53%.

5-HTP has been noted to reduce migraines, improve coordination in ataxia, improve fibromyalgia symptoms, and improve symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It also improved obesity outcomes by reducing food intake and inducing feelings of satiety.

5-HTP also acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic. 

### Summary

5-HTP is a widely-used chemical in the human body. It is responsible for being converted into serotonin and melatonin. It works by increasing serotonin synthesis. 5-HTP can be useful to supplement sleep, pain, or diet.
