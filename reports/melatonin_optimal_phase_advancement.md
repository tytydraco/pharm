# Melatonin

### Background

Melatonin is a hormone that is commonly taken for its hypnotic effects and its ability to phase shift the circadian rhythm.

This report explains the ideal timing of exogenous oral melatonin dosing to maximally phase shift the circadian rhythm.

### Report

Because the human circadian period is commonly slightly longer than 24 hours, it is easy to move it later, but it is more difficult to move it earlier.

Oral melatonin supplementation can phase shift the circadian rhythm by advancing and delaying it.

The maximum phase advancement is produced with doses of either 0.5mg or 3mg of melatonin taken 10-11 hours before the sleep midpoint, or the midpoint between the sleep time and wake time. However, supplementation at this time may cause performance impairments and sleepiness until bedtime is reached.

If side effects are unbearable, melatonin dosage may be reduced.

Maximal phase advancements were found when morning bright light was used in addition to melatonin supplementation.

### Summary

The optimal method to phase shift the circadian rhythm earlier is to supplement between 0.5mg and 3mg of melatonin 10-11 hours before the natural sleep midpoint, advancing this schedule by 1 hour every day until results are met.
