# Acetyl L-Carnitine

### Background

Acetyl L-Carnitine, or ALCAR, is an endogenously produced ester of carnitine produced by mitochondria.

This report dives into the biological role of ALCAR, and the possible effects of supplementation.

### Report

ALCAR is a key player in the metabolism of lipids and amino acids. It is primarily utilized in the mitochondria for energy production.

Chronic exogenous ALCAR supplementation increased glucose concentrations in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, but not serum concentrations. It does not alter brain glucose uptake. ALCAR supplementation also reduced lactate levels. These results indicate that ALCAR supplementation reduces the metabolism from glucose to lactate without altering the TCA cycle, leading to higher brain glucose concentrations.

ALCAR supplementation increased levels of AMP, ADP, ATP, phosphocreatine, and the ratio of phosphocreatine to creatine in mice cortices. The results suggest that ALCAR supplementation improves the brain's ability to produce high-energy phosphates and improves glucose utilization, which is neuroprotective.

ALCAR supplementation increases mice cortex myo-inositol levels, which may have a positive influence in water homeostasis disorders.

ALCAR supplementation increased levels of norepinephrine in the hippocampus and serotonin in the cortex of healthy mice. This was accompanied by a reduction in the ratio of 5-HIAA/5-HT, indicating that there is reduced serotonin turnover. ALCAR increased oxidative metabolism in astrocytes via norepinephrine level increase.

The increase in norepinephrine transmission in the brain from ALCAR is beneficial for depressed patients.

### Summary

ALCAR supplementation improves brain glucose usage, increases myo-inositol levels, and improves noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission.
