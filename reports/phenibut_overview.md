### Background

Phenibut is a GABAergic supplement that is commonly used as an anxiolytic.

This report gives an overview of Phenibut's chemical properties and pharmacology.

### Report

Phenibut, or beta-phenyl-gamma-aminobutyric acid, is structurally very similar to GABA, or gamma-aminobutyric acid, the body's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter.

Phenibut's phenyl ring allows it to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, allowing it to have strong effects on the central nervous system.

Unlike GABA, Phenibut does not possess anticonvulsive effects, but it does potentiate their activity. This may be because beta-substituted GABA derivatives reduce norepinephrine-independent GABA binding. Furthermore, some properties of GABA are lost with beta-substitution. Phenibut also causes a reduction in body temperature.

Only the right-handed dextro isomer of Phenibut is active.

At higher doses, Phenibut reduces motor activity, muscle tone, coordination, body temperature, and potentiates the effect of anesthetics.

In rats, administration of Phenibut twice daily for 5 days created a tolerance to the sedative effect on the last day, while further enhancing cognition.

In mice, Phenibut suppressed emotional reaction to pain.

In anxious cats, Phenibut reduced or completely removed fear, and induced aggressive behavior. In aggressive cats, Phenibut had no effect on aggression. In non-anxious and non-aggressive cats, Phenibut enhanced positive emotions.

Phenibut increases presynaptic GABA release. Phenibut activates GABA-B receptors, and there appears to be evidence that it does not activate GABA-A receptors. Phenibut appears to have activity on the benzodiazepine receptors as well. It also increases dopamine concentrations.

Phenibut could also be seen as a phenethylamine (PEA) derivative, blocking its action, which explains its dopaminergic effects. 

Phenibut is not metabolized, and is mostly excreted through the urine. It has a low acute toxicity.

### Summary

Phenibut is a GABA derivative with anxiolytic, sedating, and cognitive enhancing effects. It is centrally active and has relatively low acute toxicity.
