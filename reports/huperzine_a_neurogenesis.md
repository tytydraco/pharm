### Background

Huperzine-A is an alkaloid naturally found in Huperzia serrata, referred to as Chinese clubmoss or toothed clubmoss. It is available to purchase over-the-counter in the United States as a dietary supplement as either the herbal extract (Huperzia serrata extract) or the synthetic alkaloid (Huperzine A).

This report dives into the effect of Huperzine A on nerve growth factor and general neuritogenesis.

### Report

Nerve growth factor (NFG) is necessary for neurons to survive and grow. It is associated with many neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies suggest NGF synthesis could occur as a result of that cholinergic activity in the basal forebrain. Some acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, through the prevention of acetylcholine breakdown in the synaptic cleft, potentiate NGF or increase the rate of acetylcholine synthesis.

Huperzine A did not alter the rate of cell division, nor was it cytotoxic. 

Interestingly, Huperzine A doubled the occurrence of neuritis, the inflammation of peripheral nerves, in rat brain cells. Direct incubation with NGF tripled the occurrence of neuritis. This could be indicative of neuritogenesis. Additionally, NGF mRNA levels were slightly upregulated, while P75NTR (neurotrophin receptor) mRNA levels were significantly upregulated.

Huperzine A increased neurite growth and enhanced expression and secretion of NGF in rat brain cells. It is possible that this increase is the result of Huperzine A increasing the expression of acetylcholinesterase (even though it is inhibited), whose presence influences neurite growth. The increases in NGF and P75NTR expression are possibly responsible for Huperzine A's neuroprotective effects. Another possible mechanism for the increased NGF expression was Huperzine A's effect on protein kinase C (responsible for phosphorylating DNA, increasing gene expression), cholinergic, and adrenergic systems.

### Summary

Administration of Huperzine A in rat brain cells increased the expression of nerve growth factor, and P75NTR, a neurotrophin receptor site, and increased neurite growth. The survivability of neurons was significantly improved.
